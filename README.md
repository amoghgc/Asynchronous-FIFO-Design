# Asynchronous-FIFO-Design
An asynchronous FIFO refers to a FIFO design where data values are written to a FIFO buffer from one clock domain and the data values are read from the same FIFO buffer from another clock domain, where the two clock domains are asynchronous to each other.
This project implements an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer using Verilog. The FIFO allows independent read and write operations on different clock domains, making it suitable for crossing clock boundaries in digital systems like UARTs, DMA controllers, and network interfaces.
